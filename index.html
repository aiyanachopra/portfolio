      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I spent the first twelve years of my education studying at Pine-Richland School District. Once I graduated, I enrolled at the University of Michigan where I am a current Junior. While at Michigan, I am studying Information Analysis in the School of Information while pursuing a minor in Law, Justice, and Social Change. On campus, I am involved in Women in Science and Engineering, Banking at Michigan, Empowering Women in the Law, Undergraduate Research at the University of Michigan Law School, Pi Beta Phi Sorority, Galvanize the Greeks, and I also TA a Psychology Course!</p>

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>My family and I have lived in Pittsburgh our entire life. Our family consists of my mom, my dad, my sister, and most importantly our puppy Coco. My entire family is passionate about technology, seeing as my dad owns his own artificial intelligence company, my mom works in cybersecurity, and my sister is a solutions engineer at Wise! As a family, we also all love golfing together, doing yoga, and making family dinners.</p>
