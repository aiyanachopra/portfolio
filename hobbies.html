    <h2>SoulCycle</h2>
    <p>For over a year now my absolute favorite thing to do has been take SoulCycle classes at the studio in Ann Arbor! I've taken around fifty classes so far and it is my favorite way to workout and get some cardio in while at college.</p>

  <div class="travel text-block">
    <a id="travel"></a>
    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <p>Traveling and seeing the world is so important to me because I love getting to learn about new places and people. Some of my favorite places I've gone are Greece, France, Italy, and Malta. However, my favorite city in the world is actually in the United States and that is San Francisco!</p>

  <div class="golf text-block">
    <a id="golf"></a>
    <h2>Golfing </h2>
    <p> I took up golfing as a kid to spend more time with my dad! I've continued playing the last ten years of my life up until I finished high school. During high school, I played on the varsity women's golf team for four years and served as captain my junior and senior year. </p>

  <div class="triathlons text-block">
    <a id="triathlons"></a>
    <h2>Triathlons </h2>
    <p> This past summer, I decided to focus more on my fitness and combine my passion for running, biking and swimming by completing a triathlon. This was the second triathlon I've ever done and I finished a 500 meter swim, 12 mile bike, and 3.4 mile run in 1 hour and 30 minutes. </p>
